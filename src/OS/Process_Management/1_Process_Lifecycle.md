*Program vs Process*
--------------------
| Program | Process |
| --- | --- |
| Resides on the hard drive as a file | Resides within RAM |
| Passive/Inactive | Active |
| Not executable | Executable |
| CPU not giving cycles to it | CPU giving cycles to it |

*Program to Process*
--------------------
1. > The source code lives on the hard drive as a file, and it is an inert entity, which means it is not doing anything by itself. 
This code is passive/inactive and now is not executable, so this won't run.
2. > This code is compiled(source code is converted to machine code/bytecode) by a compiler(Javac).
