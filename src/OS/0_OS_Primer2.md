*What is a Process*
> A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed.
> It contains the program code and its activity.

> An application is a program that we can run on our system.
> When we install an application, it is installed as a file on our system.
> When we run the application, the operating system loads the application into memory and runs it.
> Hence, when we run an application, the operating system creates a process for the application.
