*What is a Process*
> A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed.
> It contains the program code and its activity.

> An application is a program that we can run on our system.
> When we install an application, it is installed as a file on our system.
> When we run the application, the operating system loads the application into memory and runs it.

> If we run multiple applications, the operating system creates multiple processes for the applications.
> Each process has its own memory space and is isolated from other processes.
> This is known as process isolation.

*What is PCB*
> When the process is created by the operating system it creates a data structure to store the information of that process.

> This is known as Process Control Block (PCB). PCB is a data structure that stores information of a process such as process id, process state, process priority, etc.

> It is the job of the OS to assign a CPU to a process.

> The role of the process control block arises as an identification card for each process.
> The Operating System doesn't know which process is which, until Operating System refers through the PCB of every process.

> The process control block contains many attributes such as
   - > process ID
   - > process state 
   - > process priority 
   - > List of open files, open ports, etc.
   - > Memory management information
   - > accounting information
   - > program counter & other CPU registers etc. for each process.
   
_Types of Processes_
> There are two types of processes:
   - > I/O bound process:
        - > A process that spends more time doing I/O than computations.
        - > Example: A process that reads data from a file, spends most of its time waiting for data to be read, does some computations on it, and writes the results to another file.
   - > CPU bound process:
        - > A process that spends more time doing computations than I/O.
        - > Example: A process that performs matrix multiplication, sorts a large file, etc.

*Process States*
> A process can be in one of the following states:
   - > New: The process is being created.
   - > Ready: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
   - > Running: Instructions are being executed.
   - > Waiting: The process is waiting for some event to occur(such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal).
   - > Terminated: The process has finished execution.

*What is a CPU Burst*
> A CPU burst is the time during which the process uses the CPU.

*Process Scheduling*
> The process scheduler selects an available process for program execution on the CPU based on scheduling algorithms.
> The process scheduler is a part of the operating system that decides which process runs at a certain point in time.

*Process Scheduling Algorithms*
> There are many scheduling algorithms:
   - > *First Come First Serve (FCFS):* The process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first.
        
        > Advantages:
        - > Simple to implement.
        - > No starvation.
        
        > Disadvantages:
        - > Average waiting time is high.
        - > Average turnaround time is high.
        - > Average response time is high.

   - > *Shortest Job First (SJF):* The process with the shortest burst time is allocated the CPU first.
        
        > Advantages:
        - > Average waiting time is low.
        - > Average turnaround time is low.
        - > Average response time is low.
        
        > Disadvantages:
        - > Difficult to implement.
        - > Starvation is possible.

   - > *Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):* The process with the shortest remaining time is allocated the CPU first.
        
        > Advantages:
        - > Average waiting time is low.
        - > Average turnaround time is low.
        - > Average response time is low.
        
        > Disadvantages:
        - > Difficult to implement.
        - > Starvation is possible.

   - > *Priority Scheduling:* The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first.
        
        > Advantages:
        - > Average waiting time is low.
        - > Average turnaround time is low.
        - > Average response time is low.
        
        > Disadvantages:
        - > Difficult to implement.
        - > Starvation is possible.

   - > *Round Robin Scheduling:* Each process is allocated the CPU for a fixed time slice.
        
        > Advantages:
        - > Average waiting time is low.
        - > Average turnaround time is low.
        - > Average response time is low.
        
        > Disadvantages:
        - > Context switching overhead.
        - > Average waiting time is high if the time slice is too large.
        - > Average turnaround time is high if the time slice is too large.
        - > Average response time is high if the time slice is too large.

   - > *Multilevel Queue Scheduling*: The ready queue is divided into multiple queues based on priority.
        
        > Advantages:
        - > Average waiting time is low.
