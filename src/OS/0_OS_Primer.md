*What is an OS*
> An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
> It allows us to use the Low Level APIs to interact with various components of the computer.
> It also helps in managing the resources of the computer: CPU Scheduling, Memory Management, I/O devices, etc.

*What is a Kernel*
> The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system with complete control over everything in the system.
> It is the first program loaded on start-up (after the bootloader) and manages the rest of the system.
> It is responsible for memory management, process management, device management, system calls, etc. and is the bridge between applications and the actual data processing done at the hardware level.

*What is a Shell*
> A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services.
> In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation.
> It is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
> When you open a terminal window on your Linux desktop, you are talking to the shell.
> There are different flavors of shells, but the most popular one is called bash (Bourne Again SHell) which is the default on most Linux distributions.

*What is a Terminal*
> A terminal is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell.
> It is a program that lets you send commands to your computer and receive text-based output.
> It is a command-line interface to the shell.

*What is a CLI*
> A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text.
> The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor.
> Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services.
