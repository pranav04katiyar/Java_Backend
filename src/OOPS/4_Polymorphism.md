Pillar 3: POLYMORPHISM -
Ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form (i.e. method overriding and method overloading).

How Polymorphism achieves OOPS concept:
1. Code Reusability - Method Overriding: Child class can use the method of parent class
2. Flexibility - Method Overloading: Same method name with different parameters
3. Maintainability - Method Overriding: Child class can change the implementation of parent class
4. Extensibility - Method Overriding: Child class can add new methods

Concepts in Polymorphism:
1. Method Overloading
2. Method Overriding
3. Compile Time Polymorphism (Static Binding) - Early Binding
4. Run Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding) - Dynamic Method Dispatch
5. Subtyping (Polymorphism in Inheritance) -
    5.1. Upcasting (i.e. Animal a = new Dog();)
    5.2. Downcasting (i.e. Dog d = (Dog) new Animal();)
6. Advantage & Disadvantage of Polymorphism
