*Pillar 1 - ENCAPSULATION:*
>Wrapping up of data (state) and methods (behavior) together into a single unit (i.e. class) and also hiding the data from outside world (i.e. data hiding).

_How Encapsulation implements OOPs concept?_
1. Maintainability - Encapsulated code easy to maintain.
2. Flexibility - Encapsulated code is easy to change.
3. Testability - Encapsulated code is easy to test.
4. Modularity - Encapsulated code is easy to divide in relevant state and behavior based on functionality.

_Encapsulation has two aspects:_
1. A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data: Class
2. A mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components: Access Modifiers (private, protected, public, default(package protected))

*Concepts within Encapsulation:*
1. Class & Object:

    > Attributes (or Properties or Fields) - Variables

    > Methods (or Behaviors) - Functions 

    > Constructor: Default, No-Arg, Parameterized, Copy(Shallow, Deep, Cloning), Telescoping, Overloading 

    > Destructor: finalize() method 

    > Inner Class: Static, Non-Static, Method Local, Anonymous, Nested
2. Access Modifiers
   
    > Access Modifiers (in terms of Class, Method, Variable, Constructor): private, protected, public, default(package protected)
   
    > Getter and Setter Methods
3. this keyword & this() method
4. static keyword (in terms Variable. Method, Class, Constructor)
5. final keyword (in terms of Variable, Method, Class)
6. new keyword (in terms of Object Creation & Memory Allocation)
7. return keyword: 

    > statement
   
    > type (in terms of void, primitive data type, class type)
8. main method
9. Strings[] args
