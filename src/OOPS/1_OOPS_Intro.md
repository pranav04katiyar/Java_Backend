*Principles of OOPS - ABSTRACTION:*
_Process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user._
> Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

*Pillars of OOPS:*
_Pillar 1 - ENCAPSULATION:_ 
> Wrapping up of data (state) and methods (behavior) together into a single unit (i.e. class) and also hiding the data from outside world (i.e. data hiding).

_Pillar 2 - INHERITANCE:_ 
> Process by which one class acquires the properties of another class (i.e. re-usability).

_Pillar 3 - POLYMORPHISM:_ 
> Ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form (i.e. method overriding and method overloading).

*Types of Variables:*
1. >Primitive Variables
2. >Reference Variables
3. >Static Variables
4. >Instance Variables or Non-Static Variables
5. >Final Variables
6. >Local Variables
7. >Global Variables

*Call by Value vs Call by Reference*
