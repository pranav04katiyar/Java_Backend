Pillar 2: INHERITANCE -
Process by which one class acquires the properties of another class (i.e. re-usability)/Ability to copy fields and methods from one class to another class.

Concepts in Inheritance:
1. Parent and Child Classes (Super and Sub Classes) - IS-A Relationship
    1.1. extends keyword
    1.2. super keyword
    1.3. this keyword
    1.4. constructor chaining
2. Types of Inheritance:
    a. Single Inheritance
    b. Multi-Level Inheritance
    c. Hierarchical Inheritance
    d. Multiple Inheritance (Not supported in Java)
    e. Hybrid Inheritance (Not supported in Java) - Combination of Hierarchical and Multiple Inheritance - Diamond Problem
3. Interface        //Blueprint of a behavior, contract for implementing classes, 100% abstraction, loose coupling
    3.1. implements keyword
    3.2. Interface for Diamond Problem
4. Abstract Class   //A combination of interface and concrete class. Used to achieve partial abstraction(0-100%) & loose coupling.
    4.1. abstract keyword & abstract method
    4.2. default keyword & default method
    4.3. abstract class vs interface
    4.4. abstract class vs concrete class
    4.5. abstract class vs abstract method
    4.6. abstract class vs final class
    4.7. abstract class vs final method
    4.8. abstract class vs static method
    4.9. abstract class vs constructor
