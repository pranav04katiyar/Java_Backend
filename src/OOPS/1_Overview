This package is about understanding concepts of OOPS in Java.

Principles of OOPS:
ABSTRACTION - Process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
    -> Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
    -> Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, by storing state in data structures and behavior in methods/functions.
    -> While object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data (state) and methods (behaviour) within itself, just like real life objects, having some properties/characteristics and actionable behaviours.

Pillars of OOPS:
Pillar 1: ENCAPSULATION - Wrapping up of data (state) and methods (behavior) together into a single unit (i.e. class) and also hiding the data from outside world (i.e. data hiding).
Pillar 2: INHERITANCE - Process by which one class acquires the properties of another class (i.e. re-usability).
Pillar 3: POLYMORPHISM - Ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form (i.e. method overriding and method overloading).
