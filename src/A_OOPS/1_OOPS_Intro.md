*Principles of A_OOPS - ABSTRACTION:* 
-
>_Process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user._
> Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

*Pillars of OOPS:*
-
_Pillar 1 - ENCAPSULATION:_ 
> Wrapping up of data (state) and methods (behavior) together into a single unit (i.e. class) and also hiding the data from outside world (i.e. data hiding).

_Pillar 2 - INHERITANCE:_ 
> Process by which one class acquires the properties of another class (i.e. re-usability).

_Pillar 3 - POLYMORPHISM:_ 
> Ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form (i.e. method overriding and method overloading).

*Call by Value vs Call by Reference*
-
1. >Call by Value: Passing the value of the variable as an argument, so that the parameter is initialized with the value of the variable.
2. >Call by Reference: Passing the address of the variable as an argument, so that the parameter is initialized with the address of the variable.

   > Java supports only Call by Value.

*Types of Variables:*
-
1. >Primitive Variables
2. >Reference Variables
3. >Static Variables
4. >Instance Variables or Non-Static Variables
5. >Final Variables
6. >Local Variables
7. >Global Variables

*Types of Methods:*
-
1. >Static Methods
2. >Instance Methods or Non-Static Methods
3. >Final Methods
4. >Abstract Methods
5. >Synchronized Methods
6. >Native Methods
7. >Default Methods
