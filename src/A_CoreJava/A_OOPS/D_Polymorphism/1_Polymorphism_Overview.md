*Pillar 3: POLYMORPHISM -*
-
> Ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form (i.e. method overriding and method overloading).

_How Polymorphism achieves OOPS concept:_
-
1. Code Reusability - Method Overriding: Child class can use the method of parent class
2. Flexibility - Method Overloading: Same method name with different parameters
3. Maintainability - Method Overriding: Child class can change the implementation of parent class
4. Extensibility - Method Overriding: Child class can add new methods

_Concepts in Polymorphism:_
-
1. Method Overloading
2. Method Overriding
3. Compile Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism/Early Binding)
4. Run Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism/Dynamic Method Dispatch)
5. Subtyping (Polymorphism in Inheritance) -

- > Downcasting (i.e. Dog d = (Dog) new Animal();)
