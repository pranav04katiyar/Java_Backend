# Introduction to OOPS(Object-Oriented Programming System)
## LLD: Low Level Design
Low-level design (LLD) is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step refinement process to provide the internal logical design of the actual program code.

To put it in simple terms, LLD is the process of telling the system how the software will be implemented.

LLD has the following goals:
> 1. Low level implementation details of a system
> 2. Organization of code
> 3. Writing good software

### *What is a good software?*
A good software is a software that is:
1. Easy to understand 
2. Easy to maintain: 
   > - Modular(loosely coupled, high cohesion)
   > - Reusable
   > - Analyzable
   > - Modifiable
   > - Testable
3. Easy to scale: 
   > - Adaptable
   > - Efficient
   > - Reliable
   > - Secure
   > - Can increase capacity and functionality as per the requirement.
4. Easy to extend: 
   > - Flexible
   > - Effortlessness in adding new features
   > - Enhanceable without breaking existing features. 

#### *Extensibility vs Scalability:*
Extensibility is the ability to add new features without breaking existing features - Capability(Feature functionality) based.

Scalability is the ability to increase capacity and functionality as per the requirement - Performance(Usage demand) based.

## Programming Paradigms:

- Imperative Programming: 
> - Focuses on describing how a program operates (algorithm) by providing a set of well-defined instructions to change state(data).
> - Example: Procedural Programming(Eg: C,COBOL,BASIC,FORTRAN etc), Object Oriented Programming(Eg: Java,C++,C#,Python etc)

- Declarative Programming:
> - Focuses on describing what a program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.
> - Example: SQL, HTML, CSS, XML, Functional Programming(Eg: Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, Clojure etc), Logic Programming(Eg: Prolog, Datalog etc)
