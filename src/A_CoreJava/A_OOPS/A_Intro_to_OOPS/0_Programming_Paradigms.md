# Pre-requisite to OOPS(Object-Oriented Programming System)
## LLD: Low Level Design
Low-level design (LLD) is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step refinement process to provide the internal logical design of the actual program code.

To put it in simple terms, LLD is the process of telling the system how the software will be implemented.

LLD has the following goals:
> 1. Low level implementation details of a system
> 2. Organization of code
> 3. Writing good software

### *What is a good software?*
A good software is a software that is:
1. **Easy to understand** 
2. **Easy to maintain** - Your software should be:
   > - Modular(loosely coupled, high cohesion)
   > - Reusable
   > - Analyzable
   > - Modifiable
   > - Testable
   ###### What does it mean for a software to be easily maintainable?:
    > 1. How easy it is for a new developer to contribute to the product?
    > 2. Can I add a new feature to the product without impacting existing functionality?
    > 3. Can I get an insight into the productâ€™s performance?
3. **Easy to scale** - Your software should be:
   > - Adaptable
   > - Efficient
   > - Reliable
   > - Secure
   > - Can increase capacity and functionality as per the requirement.
   ###### What does it mean for a software to be easily scalable?:
    > 1. You just expanded your business to North America and Europe. Will your software be able to handle the users?
    > 2. How will your application perform when it has multiple users using it at the same time?
    > 3. Does your application provide a good user experience?
4. **Easy to extend** - Your software should be:
   > - Flexible
   > - Effortlessness in adding new features
   > - Enhanceable without breaking existing features. 
   ###### What does it mean for a software to be easily extendable?:
    > 1. Your application uses PayTM for payment, and you want to add a new payment method. It can be a very simple task based on how your software is structured.
    > 2. You use AWS for deployment and now a client wants to use your application on their own server. Again, will your code be able to handle this?
    > 3. If I change my backend code, will my frontend code be affected?

#### *Extensibility vs Scalability:*
Extensibility is the ability to add new features without breaking existing features - Capability(Feature functionality) based.

Scalability is the ability to increase capacity and functionality as per the requirement - Performance(Usage demand) based.

## Programming Paradigms:
- Imperative Programming: 
  - Focuses on describing how a program operates (algorithm) by providing a set of well-defined instructions to change state(data).
  - Example: Procedural Programming(Eg: C,COBOL,BASIC,FORTRAN etc), Object Oriented Programming(Eg: Java,C++,C#,Python etc)

- Declarative Programming:
  - Focuses on describing what a program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.
  - Example: SQL, HTML, CSS, XML, Functional Programming(Eg: Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, Clojure etc), Logic Programming(Eg: Prolog, Datalog etc)
