## Program vs Process

| Program                             | Process                |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Resides on the hard drive as a file | Resides within RAM     |
| Passive/Inactive                    | Active                 |
| Not executable                      | Executable             |
| CPU not giving cycles to it         | CPU giving cycles to it |

## Program to Process

1. > The source code lives on the hard drive as a file, and it is an inert entity, which means it is not doing anything by itself. 
This code is passive/inactive and now is not executable, so this won't run.
2. > This code is compiled(source code is converted to machine code/bytecode) by a compiler(Javac).
